# Code Coverage Tester App

Install this simple app and fire it up like so via CommandBox:

```
CommandBox> mkdir code-coverage --cd
CommandBox> install bdw429s/code-coverage-test
CommandBox> start
```

To use the CommandBox embedded server, install the `commandbox-fusionreactor` module and register your FusionReactor license key.

```
install commandbox-fusionreactor
fr register "XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX"
```

The CF Performance Explorer app from Integral will install to `/cfperformanceexplorer`.

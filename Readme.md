# Code Coverage Tester App

Install this simple app and fire it up like so via CommandBox:

```
CommandBox> mkdir code-coverage --cd
CommandBox> install bdw429s/code-coverage-test
CommandBox> start
```

You'll need to edit the path to the Fusion-Reactor jar in `server.json`.  This only works with FR 6.

The CF Performance Explorer app from Integral will install to `/cfperformanceexplorer`.

# Code Coverage Tester App

Install this simple app and fire it up like so via CommandBox:

```install bdw429s/code-coverage-test
start```

You'll need to edit the path to the Fusion-Reactor jar in `server.json`.  This only works with FR 6.

The CF Performance Explorer app from Integral will install to `/cfperformanceexplorer`.
